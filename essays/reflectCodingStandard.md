## What are coding standards and why do we need them??

There is a reason as to why programming languages are called languages. Like any language, we conform to grammar in order to convey our thoughts precisely and concisely. Without grammar and correct puntuations, we might mislead our audience, or our audience might misunderstand us. This is the same with programming languages. In the beginning we might write code that does not follow a certain standard, as long as it works, then it's good. But as we write more and more code and our programs starts to have dozens and hundreds, and most likely we'll reach a point where we are writing thousands of lines of code; coding standards starts to prevail. Programming is like surfing, if you can stand on the board and maneuver it, then essentially you know how to to surf. Yet, every surfer has their own style as to how to maneuver their board. Programming is the same, anyone can program, but everyone also has their own style. This style is what leads to issues, though.

The fact is, once we step our foot into the professional world, these thousands of lines of code will most likely be written by multiple people at the same time. Therefore, we need a certain uniformity in order for our teammates to understand what we are writing and vice versa. However, unlike spoken languages, programming language "grammar" can vary. Usually set by the industry or by company. Whichever is the case, it is best to adhere to them, afterall, you are now a professional and you are obligated to follow the rules. 

By following a coding standard, it ensures that what you are writing can be easily interpreted by you and a your teammates. Coding in a standard format allows your code to be easily scaled by anyone else other than yourself. You can think of scaling like you are writing an introduction to a book and your co-authors can easily append furthur information. Likewise, when your teammates are following the same standard, then it's easy for you to expand on their code as well. If you don't even understand what they are trying to convey, then how can you continue where they left off? 

Additionally, your code can be be reused on other parts of the project or a whole new project altogether. We often find ourselves writing the same code over and over again. We can significantly reduce the time we spend on our code if we can reuse bits of code that we have previously wrote. This also helps us in the future when we need to look back to older code.

To put it together, coding standards ensures your code is:
* Readable
* Scalable
* Professional
* Reuseable
* Consistent

Now go out there and do some "standarding".
