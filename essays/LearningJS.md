  Learning Javascript is like getting thrown into the deep end of the pool by your dad even though he knows you can't swim.

Fortunately, there is freeCodeCamp that acts like a "pool noodle" so I don't actually drown. After about 140 exercises I kind of get the hang of it! What I like the most is JS's type inference similar to Scala's. For example, in C, we need to indicate a data type like so:```
int age = 20;``` But in JavaScript, all we need to do is simply ```var age = 20```!
