## Is ignorance a bad thing?
I think the word "ignorant" is thrown around way too often now-a-days. It is almost interchangeable with "stupidty". But one can take a look at the true definition of "ignorance" and find that it simply means a person is lacking knowledge or unaware of a particular thing. In my opinion, based on the definition, "ignorance" does not seem to be a pejorative term. A genius who excels in physics might be ignorant of botany, that certaily does not make he or she a stupid person. 

## Is there a such thing as a stupid question?
Let's take our genius physicist for another example. Suppose he or she asks a question a very simple question regarding botany. As a genius botanist, would you think that they are stupid for asking such a easy question? I wouldn't think so, however, asking simple questions leaves me the impression that this individual is lazy. We live in a era that any information can be accessed at any moment. There really shouldn't be any reason for people to be asking questions that can be found with a simple Google search. 

## I can't find the answer, now what?
Well, now you gotta ask questions! But hold your horses, how to ask questions is really a art form. Asking "smart" questions well most likely get you a respond and more likely to get you an answer. On the contrary, if your question is full of grammar mistakes or not technical enough, how do you expect people understand your problem and help you?
