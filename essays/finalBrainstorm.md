## Overview
The problem: Many UH students find it difficult to figure out times to schedule an appointment with professors. Based on the students class schedule and professor schedule. Going back and forth between emails can be quite a hassle for both parties. 

The Solution: The PS-Link will assist both students and professors to set up times they are available. This application will provide a directory in which students/faculty can login to an organized directory in which students can schedule an appointment with their professors based on student class schedule vs. professors specified open times. 

## Approach
PS-Link has two user roles: the students(user) and the professors(admin). Both roles will be able to review the schedule timeline for the upcoming weekdays. Professors will first set up the availability of office hours to meet up with any students having issues with their academic career. Then the students can browse the availability of the professors and choose a comfortable time to schedule an appointment.


Some possible mockup pages include:

- Landing Page
- Student Page
- Professor Page
- Contact Support


## Use case ideas

Professor goes to the landing page, logs in, and gets to the professor page which will be an appointment setter page. Professor can set the dates that he or she is available and this information is shown on his or her card


Student goes to the landing page, logs in, gets to the student page which will be an appointment selection page. Students can find the professors card which will have the professors available times shown.
