This is a little project I have been working on for the pass month or so. Scala was created by Martin Odersky back in 2001 to show that a fusion of object oriented programming and functional programming was possible and practical. 

Scala is a very interesting language, it's parent language is Java and programs can be written in a total imperative style. If you know Java then Scala is very easy to grasp and you can code in a "Java style". For example the code below shows quicksort written "imperative style" with Scala.
