## Self Assessment
Another round of teammates carrying me the finish line, however, this time I can definitely say I contributed more than the last project. Sometimes I think taking this class was a mistake. But after two projects, I've made peace with the burden I bring upon my teammates, and accepted the fact that at least I have learned a lot more than I would have just taking ICS 314. The past two projects have allowed me to practice more and familiarize with the structure of Meteor applications. This is evident with the time I spend on WODS in ICS 314. I do not rely on memorizing which files go to which directories or when to use a certain command. I learned how links work when a button is clicked and the page is redirected. Very trivial and very little contribution to my team, but I can say with modesty that I put in the time and the effort to understand how the code works and helped whenever I could, or tried whenever I think I can. We are at the mid point of the semester and I am excited that my teammates have not kicked me off the team. For our last project, I aim to work more on the backend because that is where the heavy duty work resides; by doing so, I hope to redeem some respect from my teammates for being a total noob in the beginning.
