Honushield is an application similar to the UH Lumisight app implemented with Meteor and JavaScript.

It allows students to register with their email and then they can upload their vaccination record.

There is also a daily check-in to see if they have any COVID symptoms.

This project really challenged me because I do not have the tech stacks required. I am learning Meteor and JavaScript in another class taken concurrently and really feel pressured because I have to essentially self-teach Meteor and JavaScript in order to keep up. It is still a working progress but we have most of the application working.
