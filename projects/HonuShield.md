## Overview
Honushield is an application similar to the UH Lumisight app implemented with Meteor and JavaScript.

It allows students to register with their email and then they can upload their vaccination record.

There is also a daily check-in to see if they have any COVID symptoms.

## Self-assessment
Best way to sum up this project is that I got carried hard by my teammates. It was really challenging to me because I did not have the tech stacks required at the time. I am learning Meteor and JavaScript in another class taken concurrently and I have to essentially self-teach Meteor and JavaScript in advance in order to keep up. Fortunately, my teammates are really helpful and the project was over a period of two months. I was able to implement the landing page over a few days of no sleep.
