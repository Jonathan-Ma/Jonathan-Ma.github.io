summary: A project I did in ICS 212 that has a UI and takes in user information and stores it on a text file.
---
This project was written in C and later in the semester translated to C++. The program runs on terminal, which was considered the user interface, it allows you to add, delete, print all client info, or find a specific account using the account number. When exiting the program, you can specify which file to write to and the information stored as a linked list will be written onto the file. At the start of the program you can also specify afile to read from and all client information is then stored on the heap.
